\section{Acknowledgments}
\vspace{0.5in}
This research would not have been possible without the help of several faculty members at Olin College. As such, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the following people:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Professor David Barrett for his guidance and advice throughout this project as well as his help in manufacturing parts to build the prototype
\item Professor Rebecca Christianson who gave me the very quick refresher on magnetism and magnetic fields that I desperately needed
\item Professor Jose Oscar Mur-Miranda who taught me so much about efficient magnetic actuator design

\end{enumerate}
