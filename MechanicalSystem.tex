\section{The Mechanical System}

\subsection{The Original Components}
Most of the mechanical components on board the vehicle were installed by the SCOPE team that first worked on the vehicle in 2009 - 2010. As such, this section begins by including the original pages from the 2009 - 2010 SCOPE team report describing the mechanical system. \\ \\

Today, this mechanical system remains largely the same except for the following changes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The monitor mentioned in the original SCOPE team report is the Nortec SUN-1710-P daylight-visible monitor. The current monitor on the vehicle is a standard Acer monitor
