\chapter{Overview of the Software Architecture}
The software that runs the Gator includes a stack running on Robot Operating System (ROS) on the Intel Nuc computer in Linux and a second stack running in LabVIEW on the windows 7 %rack computer. The LabVIEW code is designed to be minimally intrusive to any intelligent operation. It's sole purpose is to keep the vehicle safe and prevent the vehicle from sustaining %damage. The ROS code, on the otherhand, is designed to have most of the intelligence required for performing missions. This segregation of responsibility therefore facilitates different %teams with different mission requirements, allowing any team to run their code on the vehicle with minimal additional set up time. As long as the ROS-LabVIEW interface is obeyed, the %software architecture will support swapping out the ROS-based code at any time and the vehicle should still run.\\ \\
%
\noindent The software on the vehicle is broken up into three main parts: Forebrain, Midbrain and Hindbrain. Each part has a different function and operating speed. The hindbrain has %the fastest operating speed and is used for low-level control of the control surfaces on the vehicle such as the gas and brake pedals. As such, the hindbrain is implemented on a National %Instruments NI FPGA. The midbrain has two parts: one handling LabVIEW internal processing and another handling passing of sensor and vehicle information from LabVIEW to ROS. %Finally, the forebrain is entirely ROS-based and handles all the high-level processing tasks such as path planning and intelligent obstacle avoidance. \\ \\

In the upcoming chapters, the various components of the software stack will be discussed in full detail.
